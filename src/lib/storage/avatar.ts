/**
 * Profile photos: what may be uploaded, where it goes, and how it is shown.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THIS FEATURE
 * The browser uploads and deletes directly against Supabase Storage, under
 * policies that allow a user to touch only their own `users/<uid>/avatar/`
 * prefix. The API never handles image bytes and never returns a URL: it stores
 * and validates an object *path*, which is what `PATCH /me` writes. So this
 * module is storage-side, and the only thing it tells the API is which key it
 * used.
 *
 * WHY THE FILES ARE RE-ENCODED
 * The bucket caps an object at 2 MiB, and a photo from a phone is routinely
 * larger than that, so uploading it unchanged would fail with an opaque storage
 * error on exactly the files users actually have. Re-encoding through a canvas
 * both resizes the image to something an avatar can use and drops the container's
 * metadata — EXIF, including location — which a re-encode cannot carry forward.
 * The cost is that the stored bytes are not the user's original file, which is
 * why `prepareAvatar` is explicit about producing them rather than uploading
 * directly.
 *
 * THE NAME IS GENERATED, AND THE PATH IS CONSTRAINED
 * The object name is 32 random hex characters, never anything the user chose. A
 * user-supplied name is where a second extension, a traversal, or an executable
 * MIME type comes from, and the database refuses the whole class:
 * `profiles.avatar_path` is checked against `users/<the row's own user_id>/avatar/<32 hex>.<ext>`.
 * `avatarObjectKey` below produces exactly that shape, and `isAvatarPathFor`
 * re-states it so the UI can tell a path it may render from one it may not.

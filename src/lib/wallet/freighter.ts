/**
 * Freighter adapter (MVP wallet).
 *
 * Freighter's API does not throw. Every call resolves to an object carrying an
 * optional `error`, and on failure the value fields are left as empty strings —
 * `signTransaction` on failure resolves to `{ signedTxXdr: '', signerAddress: '',
 * error }`. Treating that as a value rather than a fault is the single easiest
 * way to misuse this library, so every call goes through `unwrap` below, which
 * turns an errored response into a thrown `WalletError`.
 *
 * The declared `error` field is typed against an internal alias that is not
 * resolvable from outside the package (`@shared/api/types`), and in practice it
 * can be a bare string. Responses are therefore narrowed structurally to
 * `ErrorBearing` rather than relying on that type.

/**
 * Wallet abstraction.
 *
 * Everything in this app that needs a signature goes through this interface, so
 * that adding a wallet is an adapter rather than a change to feature code, and
 * so that the rules that keep the app non-custodial live in one place:
 *
 *   - The app never sees a private key, a seed phrase, or a signed blob it did
 *     not construct.
 *   - The signing network passphrase is supplied by the caller, derived from
 *     validated configuration, never chosen by the wallet.
 *   - A returned signature is only a candidate. It is still unconfirmed until
 *     the chain says otherwise (see `lib/stellar/result.ts`).

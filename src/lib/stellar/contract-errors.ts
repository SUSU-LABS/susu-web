/**
 * Contract error decoding.
 *
 * The contracts return `Result<_, ContractError>` rather than panicking, so a
 * rejected call is a normal, expected outcome — "you already contributed",
 * "the round is not fully funded yet" — not a crash. Soroban surfaces that
 * outcome in two different shapes depending on where it happened, and both are
 * decoded here:
 *
 *   - Simulation rejected the call before submission. The RPC returns a host
 *     error string containing `Error(Contract, #N)`.
 *   - The transaction was submitted and applied, but failed. The failure is in
 *     the result XDR.
 *
 * Anything unrecognized is reported as opaque rather than guessed at. A wrong
 * explanation of a failed financial transaction is worse than none.

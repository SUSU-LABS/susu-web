/**
 * Linking a wallet to an account.
 *
 * THE CLAIM, AND WHAT PROVES IT
 * Linking says "this Stellar account is mine". Without a proof that would be
 * "tell us any address you like", and the address column would be a free-text
 * field the rest of the system treats as an identity. So the API issues a nonce,
 * the wallet signs a message the API constructed, and the API verifies the
 * signature against the public key the address itself names.
 *
 * The signing happens in `lib/wallet`, through the adapter, so this module never
 * touches a wallet: it asks the API for something to sign, hands the text to a
 * caller-provided signing function, and returns the signature. That split is what
 * lets the flow be tested without a browser extension.
 *
 * WHAT THE SIGNATURE AUTHORISES
 * Nothing on chain. The message says so, and it names the account, the address,
 * the network and the nonce, so a signature cannot be replayed into a different
 * account, network or request. It is not a transaction and cannot move funds.

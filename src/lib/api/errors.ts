/**
 * How the API reports failure, and what this app says about it.
 *
 * The API answers a failed request with a small machine-readable code —
 * `invalid_request`, `invite_not_found`, `invite_exhausted` — and never with a
 * sentence. That is deliberate: the same code has to serve a web client, a script
 * and a future mobile app, and a server that writes the user-facing copy for one of
 * them writes it badly for the others.
 *
 * So the mapping from code to English lives here, on the client, where the
 * audience is known. Anything unmapped falls back to a generic sentence rather
 * than forwarding the raw code, because `invite_not_found` is not a thing to say
 * to a person.
 *
 * THE ONE DISTINCTION WORTH KEEPING
 * `invite_exhausted` is reported differently from `invite_not_found`, matching the
 * API. An unknown, expired or revoked code gets one identical answer, because any
 * difference confirms that a guessed code is real. An exhausted code is the
 * opposite case: the caller had a real code, did nothing wrong, and the remedy —
 * ask for a new invite — is specific and useful.

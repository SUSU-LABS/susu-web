/**
 * The account surface, as this app uses it.
 *
 * This is the only part of the app that describes the *account* rather than the
 * protocol: the display name, the optional photo, the wallet that has been
 * proved, and the feed of chain activity across that wallet's groups.
 *
 * WHY THE TOKEN IS A PARAMETER
 * As in `invites.ts`, the caller supplies the token rather than this module
 * reading the session. That keeps the module testable without a browser session
 * and makes it visible at every call site that the request is authenticated.
 *
 * WHAT THE WALLET ADDRESS IS AND IS NOT
 * `walletAddress` is a server-side binding proved by a signature over a nonce,
 * stored by the API. It is not the connected wallet — that is a browser fact, and
 * the two can differ: a user may be signed in with one account, hold a wallet
 * linked to that account, and have a different wallet connected right now. This
 * module reports the binding, never the connection.

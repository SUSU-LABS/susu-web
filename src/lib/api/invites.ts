/**
 * Invites, as this app uses them.
 *
 * An invite code is opaque: random, unguessable, and unrelated to the group's
 * address. That is a change from the first version of this flow, which put the
 * contract address in the link. The reasoning behind that version was sound about
 * authority — the address grants nothing, and the contract decides who may join —
 * and wrong about secrecy, because a contract address is published on chain and
 * can be enumerated. A link that contains one is a link everyone already has.
 *
 * So the code is a secret, and this module treats it as one: it is put in the URL
 * path for a human to share, sent to the API in a request body rather than a
 * query string so it does not land in server logs, and never stored — the API
 * cannot return it after creation, so there is nothing to store.

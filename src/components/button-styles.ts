/**
 * The classes a button wears, apart from the `Button` component.
 *
 * These live in their own module for two reasons. A file that exports both
 * components and plain functions opts out of fast refresh — the rule the linter
 * enforces above, and the same reason the auth context is kept apart from its
 * provider. And the styles are needed by two different things: the `Button`
 * component, and navigations that must look like a button but be a real anchor,
 * which is what a router `Link` renders.
 *
 * That second caller is why this is not merely tidiness. A `<button>` that calls
 * `navigate()` cannot be opened in a new tab, copied as a link, or followed
 * without JavaScript; an anchor can. Sharing the styles is what keeps the two
 * from drifting into looking like different things.

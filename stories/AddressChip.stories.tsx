 * and visually-hidden text. It also provides a one-click copy-to-clipboard affordance.
 *
 * The values below are the Testnet deployments recorded in the project's own
 * configuration (`.env.example` and `susu-contracts/docs/TESTNET.md`). Contract
 * addresses are public — they are on the chain, and every node has them — so
 * there is nothing to redact, and a truncated-looking fake would hide how the
 * truncation actually behaves at the real length.
